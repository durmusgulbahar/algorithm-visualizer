          Linear search is a straightforward method used to find a specific item
          in a list. It works by starting at the beginning of the list and
          checking each item one by one until it finds the item it's looking for
          or reaches the end of the list. If the item is found, the search can
          stop and return the position of the item. If the list ends without
          finding the item, then the item isn't in the list. It's called
          "linear" because it goes through items in a sequence, just like a
          line.
